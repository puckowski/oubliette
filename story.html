                    The Free City of Tyhr, the surrounding towns, and the surrounding villages were recently prosperous and peaceful. However, dark forces from the north 
                    have crept in and have begun corrupting the land. Evil creatures, imbued with magic, sap the might from all those who seek to defend their homeland.

                    Most, even the brave, are now in hiding in their homes. They pray that the evil creatures do not pass by in the night. Many flock to the cities which
                    are overwhelmed. Demons, and even Lesser Dragons, block the path between settlements. But worse still, word of a Greater Dragon entering the lands
                    around Tyhr has begun to spread, terrifying an already troubled populace.

            <p>
                    With the Greater Dragon comes a potent dark magic that causes the land to spoil. A brave hero is needed to slay the Greater Dragon that now calls 
                    the Tyhrann Dungeon its home, before the lands are reduced to nothing but ghost cities and ghost towns.
